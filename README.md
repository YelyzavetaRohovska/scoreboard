const match1 = new FootballMatch("Mexico", "Canada");
match1.updateScore(0, 5);

const match2 = new FootballMatch("Spain", "Brazil");
match2.updateScore(10, 2);

const match3 = new FootballMatch("Germany", "France");
match3.updateScore(2, 2);

const match4 = new FootballMatch("Uruguay", "Italy");
match4.updateScore(6, 6);

const match5 = new FootballMatch("Argentina", "Australia");
match5.updateScore(3, 1);

console.log(FootballScoreboard.getSortedMatchesResults());
```

Expected result:
```bash
1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
